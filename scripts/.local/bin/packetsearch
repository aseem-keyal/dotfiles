# Description: dmenu-based packet search utility, works by:
#		1) First type query
# 		2) Enter directory
# 		3) Select packet (Ctrl+Enter to select multiple packets)
# Dependencies: dmenu, recoll, zathura (can be replaced with another pdf viewer)

# Save query using dmenu prompt
query="$(echo "" | dmenu -p "Query:")"

# Only go further if we have a query
if [ -n "$query" ]; then
	# Display choices for directory of search
	dir="$(echo -e '/\n/Collegiate/\n/HS/\n/MS/' | dmenu)"
	# Only go further if we have a directory
	if [ -n "$dir" ]; then
		# Use bash parameter substitution to get the last word of the query
		query_last_word="${query##* }"
		# Use bash parameter substitution to make last word lowercase
		query_search="${query_last_word,,}"
		# Go to chosen directory
		(cd ~/documents/packet_archive$dir && \
			# Run recoll search using chosen directory
			recoll -t "dir:documents/packet_archive$dir $query" | 
			# Use grep with following flags:
			# -o prints only matching portion
			# -P uses Perl for non-greedy modifier support (i.e. match first "]")
			# grep matches the following pattern non-greedily [file:///<anything here>]
			grep -o -P "\[file:///.*?\]" | 
			# This line removes everything up to and including the chosen
			# directory name.
			# This line uses bash's parameter expansion on the dir variable 
			# to replace all instances of forward slashes to escaped forward
			# slashes. This is done by by ${var//pattern/replacement}
			# The forward slash preceding the pattern means that all instances
			# of the pattern are replaced with the replacement. Also, the slashes
			# in both the pattern and replacement must be escaped, which leads to
			# this mess of slashes
			sed -e "s/^.*packet_archive${dir//\//\\/}//g; s/\]//g;" | 
			# This line removes the closing square bracket
			# sed -e 's/\]//g' | 
			# Sort the resulting files in reverse order (newer packets first)
			sort -r | 
			# Display in dmenu vertically with 35 rows, make search case insensitive
			dmenu -i -l 35 | 
			# When using ctrl+Enter in dmenu to select multiple choices, marking
			# and then pressing enter on a choice causes it to be sent twice.
			# Use uniq to remove this possible duplication when opening more than one packet
			uniq | 
			# Pass selected file or files to xargs (with -r flag in case no file selected)
			# Open with zathura and try to find query using lowercase last word of search
			xargs -r zathura -f "$query_search")
